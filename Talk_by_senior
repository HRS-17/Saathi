Subject: Opportunity to Inspire: Share Your Insti Journey with Freshers

Dear Seniors,

As part of the SAATHI Immersion programme , we are offering a unique opportunity for a few selected 4th and 5th year students to address the incoming batch and share their experiences from insti life.
We're looking for seniors from diverse backgrounds – academics, sports, entrepreneurship, design, media, tech, or any other sphere – who can give freshers a glimpse of the journeys that make insti life unforgettable.
Each selected speaker will get 10 minutes on stage to talk about their personal journey, learnings, turning points, and what made their time in insti truly special.

If you’d like to be considered for this opportunity, please fill out this short form: <Google Form>

The final set of speakers will be shortlisted based on diversity and relevance of experiences.
This is your chance to inspire and shape how freshers see the road ahead.

Warm regards,
Naman
Core , Team Saathi
